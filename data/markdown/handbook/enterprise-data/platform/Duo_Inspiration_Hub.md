    * **Prompt:** “Can you explain how to run a linear regression in Python to predict housing prices based on square footage and number of bedrooms?”



### 2\. **Automating Data Documentation**

  * **Code Explanation:** It can generate detailed explanations or summaries of scripts or functions in Python, R, or SQL. 
    * **Prompt:** “Can you explain this Python function that calculates the moving average of stock prices in simple terms?”
  * **Project Documentation:** Automate the creation of project documentation by summarizing workflows, codebases, or data pipeline processes. 
    * **Prompt:** “Generate a summary of this data pipeline that pulls data from Snowflake, transforms it in Python, and then uploads the results to a Tableau dashboard.”
  * **Glossary Creation:** Automatically generate glossaries for key terms, functions, or dataset variables used in data projects. 
    * **Prompt:** “Create a glossary for a data project that includes terms like ETL, data warehouse, normalization, and machine learning.”



### 3\. **Code Troubleshooting and Optimization**

  * **Debugging:** Help diagnose issues with Python, R, or SQL code, suggest solutions, and fix common errors in data workflows. 
    * **Prompt:** “I’m getting an error when trying to merge two pandas DataFrames on a date column. Here’s my code. Can you help me identify what’s wrong?”
  * **Refactoring Code:** Provide recommendations for optimizing and refactoring code to improve readability and performance. 
    * **Prompt:** “Here’s my Python code that calculates statistics for a dataset. Can you suggest improvements for readability and performance?”



### 4\. **Workflow and Process Optimization**

  * **Pipeline Monitoring:** Analyze logs and provide insights about data pipeline failures, delays, or anomalies. 
    * **Prompt:** “Analyze this error log from our data pipeline and suggest possible causes for why the ETL process failed midway through the transformation step.”
  * **Procedure Automation:** Assist in automating parts of workflows by generating scripts to run common processes like ETL tasks or data validation. 
    * **Prompt:** “Generate a Python script to automate the process of checking for missing data in a CSV file and logging the results.”

    * **Create a Custom SQL Query**
      * **Prompt:** “Help me write a query to retrieve data from Snowflake and filter the results by the last 30 days before feeding it into a Tableau dashboard.”
    * **Help teams identify relevant KPIs and metrics**
      * **Prompt:** “Suggest key performance indicators (KPIs) for a retail dashboard focused on customer retention and sales growth.”
  * **Report Summarization:** Summarize data insights or the results of analyses into concise and clear language for stakeholders. 
    * **Prompt:** “Summarize the key findings from this dataset, including total sales by region, customer churn rate, and the top-selling product.”
  * **Documentation**
    * **Write a dashboard description**
      * **Prompt:** “I have a dashboard reporting on Customer Success achieving attainment goals, write a 2 sentence description for the dashboard.”
